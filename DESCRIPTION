Description: The goal of acquaint is to enable LLM-enabled tools like Claude Code to 
    learn about the R packages you have installed using the 
    [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP). 
    Tools configured with acquaint can peruse package documentation and learn 
    to use R packages even if they weren't included in their training data.
